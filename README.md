Single-threaded CPU-based Community OVerlap PRopagation Algorithm ([COPRA]) for
[community detection].

This is an implementation of a label-propagation based community detection
algorithm called **Community OVerlap PRopagation Algorithm (COPRA)**. Unlike
**RAK**, this algorithm uses *multiple labels per vertex*, with each label having an
associated *belonging coefficient* (which sums to `1`). The algorithm is as follows.

1. Each vertex initializes as its own community (belonging=1).
2. Each iteration, a vertex collects labels from its neighborhood.
3. I excludes a vertex's own labels, although not explicitly mentioned in paper.
4. The collected labels are scaled by edge weights for weighted graph.
5. Each vertex picks labels above a certain threshold.
6. This threshold is inversely proportional to the max. number of labels.
7. If all labels are below threshold, pick a random best label.
8. I make a vertex join its own community if it has no labels (not mentioned).
9. Selected labels are normalized such that belonging coefficient sums to 1.
10. Repeat from 2 until convergence.

The authors of this paper mention to use a *mimimum vertices per community count*
to detect convergence. However i do not find it to be helpful. I instead use a
similar convergence condition as *RAK*, that is **count the number of vertices that**
**change thier best label**. Once this count falls below a certain fraction
(tolerance), i consider the algorithm to have converged. The authors also
mention using a *sychrounous* version of the algorithm, where labels of each
vertex is dependent only upon labels in previous iteration. However, i find
**asynchronous** approach to be converge faster (labels of each vertex can be
dependent upon labels in current iteration). As we focus of finding disjoint
communities, i consider the **best label of each vertex** as the final result.

I vary the **tolerance** from `0.1` to `0.0001` (as with [RAK]), and adjust the **max.**
**number of labels** from `1` to `32`.

On average, it *seems that using a single label is best* in terms of time as well
as modularity. This is particulary true in case of road networks, but *not so in*
*case of other classes of graphs* (web graphs, social networks, collaboration
networks). For example, *web graphs* such as `web-Stanford` and `web-BerkStan` achieve
best modularity with **max. labels** of `8`, `web-Google` does best with **max. labels** of
`32`, and `web-NotreDame` does best with **max. labels** of `16`. **Max. labels** of `4`-`16`
would be a good choice for such graphs.

In addition it seems that on average, *making the tolerance tighter than 0.01 has*
*no beneficial effect on modularity*. However, *tighter tolerance does not help*
*with* graphs such as `web-NotreDame`, `coAuthorsDBLP`, and *social networks*. It seems
a **tolerance** of `0.01` would be a good choice on average.

Both **RAK** and **COPRA** approaches can obtain *disconnected communities*. This issue
can be resolved by splitting such communities into separate communities in a
*post-processing step*. I do **not** do that here. We may do it when comparing these
approaches.

All outputs are saved in a [gist] and a small part of the output is listed here.
Some [charts] are also included below, generated from [sheets]. The input data
used for this experiment is available from the [SuiteSparse Matrix Collection].
